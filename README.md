# About GreedyScheduler 

## Overview

This software development project encompasses a solution developed to optimize class schedules and minimize conflicts. The project focuses on a web-based application that organizes class schedules using the Greedy graph coloring algorithm.

## Technologies Used and Key Concepts

- **Database:** Basic data management is provided using three tables named "Courses", "Instructors", and "Instructor_Courses" in MySQL database.
- **Web Technologies:** A local server is created using XAMPP and Apache, PHP is used for data retrieval, and HTML is used for designing the user interface.
- **Algorithm:** The Greedy graph coloring algorithm is utilized to color class schedules to prevent conflicts.
- **Python and Graph Libraries:** A file written in Python utilizes the networkx and matplot libraries to visually represent the class schedule.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Set up a MySQL database and add basic data.
3. Create a local server using XAMPP and Apache.
4. Launch the web application by running the `index.php` file in the project's root directory.

## Project Structure

- **Database:** Contains MySQL tables and basic data.
- **Web Application:** Includes an application built using XAMPP, PHP, and HTML to optimize class schedules.
- **Graph Representation:** Contains a file written in Python that utilizes the networkx and matplot libraries for visual representation. <br>
